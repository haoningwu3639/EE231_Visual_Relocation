# Requirements
Code tested on following environments, but unluckily, other version may not work:
* python 3.6
* pytorch 0.4.0
* tensorflow 1.12.0
* CUDA 9.0
* folium

# Dataset
We have captured a dataset of landmark buildings inside Shanghai Jiao Tong University for our GPS location program. You can download them at the following link: [SJTU_Landmarks_Dataset](https://jbox.sjtu.edu.cn/l/LFjMRw), the password is SJTU. If you have any questions, please contact us via email.

# Project Structure
* [`HFNet`](HFNet): Improved version of HFNet, you can refer to the HFNet documentation to run the codes.
* [`SuperPoint`](SuperPoint): Reproduction of SuperPoint.
* [`location`](location.py): Relocation scripts written by us, maybe you need to apply for a key of Tencent Map developer key first.
* Considering the size limitation of GitHub repository, we didn't publish the models and large files, and only saved the empty folders to show the corresponding document locations. You can refer to those original projects to download pretrained models and run the codes, contact us via email if you're in trouble.

# Results 
 Some image results have been shown in the report, contact us for more details.

# Miscs
 Since we still have a lot of work to do, we have no time to maintain this project now. We hope that we can further improve this repository when we are free in the future. If you have any questions, please contact us by email. Thanks.
